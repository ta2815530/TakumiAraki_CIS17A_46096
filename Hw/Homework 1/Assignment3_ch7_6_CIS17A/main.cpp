/*
 *An amateur meteorologist wants to keep track of weather conditions during the
 * past year's three-month summer season and has designated each day as either rainy ('R')
 *  , cloudy ('C'), or sunny ('S'). Write a program that stores this information in a
 * 3 * 30 array of characters, where the row indicates the month (0=June, 1=July, 2=August)
 * and the column indicates the day of the month. Note that data are not being collected 
 * for the 31st of any month. The program should begin by reading the weather data
 * in from a file. Then it should create a report that displays , for each month 
 * and for the whole three-month period, how many days were rainy, how many were cloudy, a
 * nd how any were sunny. It should also report which of the three months and the
 *  largest number of rainy days. Date for the program can be found in found in
 * the RainOrShine.txt file.
