/*
Weather Statistics
Write a program that uses a structure to store the following weather data for 
a particular month:
 * 
Month
Total Rainfall - Inches
High Temperature - Degrees Fahrenheit
Low Temperature -Degrees Fahrenheit
Average Temperature - Degrees Fahrenheit
 * 
The program should have an array of 12 structures to hold weather data for an
entire year. When the program runs, it should ask the user to enter data for each
month. (The average temperature should be calculated.) Once the data are entered
for all the months, the program should calculate and display the average monthly
rainfall, the total rainfall for the year, the highest and lowest temperatures for the
year (and the months they occurred in), and the average of all the monthly average
temperatures.
 * 
Input Validation: Only accept temperatures within the range between â€“100 and +140
degrees Fahrenheit.
